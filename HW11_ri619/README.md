# PUI2018 HW 11

Collaborations: For this assignment I worked extensively with Liu Chang (Angel), Tanya Nabila and Sarah Sachs

## ASSIGNMENTS:

### Assignment 1. Event Detection, Trend Analysis, Random Forests
  Assignment 1 involved working with event detection, trend analysis and random forests for MTA station data over a four year period. In the event detection, we found that Hurricane Sandy contributed to a major decrease in subway ridership. Additionally, we found that there were various card types that showed a steady increase in use over the four years we used. 


### Assignment 2. 

  For this assignment, I modified my plot based on comments from classmates. I changed my plot to show standardization rather than log to better represent the number of taxi complaints per cafe location.
