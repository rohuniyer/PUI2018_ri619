**Collaborations**
For this homework I worked extensively with Angel Liu, as well as with Sarah Sachs, Tanya Nabila.

**Assignment 1.** 

This assignment was a continuation of last week's homework. In this assignment we were to look into the subway ridership over a nearly 4 year period and, using a Fourier transform, look for periodicity in the data.


**Assignment 2.**

In this assigment, we analyzed the change in the number of establishments in NYC Zipcodes over a 21 year period from 1994-2014. We performed a K-means cluster analysis as well as a Agglomerative cluster analysis to study the relationships between the zipcodes over this period.
