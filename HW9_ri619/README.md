## ASSIGNMENTS:

For Assignment 2 and 3, I worked with Angel Lau, Sarah Sachs, and Tanya Nabila.

# Assignment 1

For this assignment I was assigned Cyrus Blankinship and Kenji Uchimoto. 


## Assignment 2: exercises with linear regression using statsmodels

This assignment introduces linear regressions with and without weights and errors to show the power of regressions. 

## Assignment 3: investigate linear relationships between fire arm possession, homicides by fire arms, and mass shootings for different countries, considering also the country GDP

This assignment expands on Assignment 2 by applying it to a real world problem. In this case we looked at mass shootings, firearms and populations for some of the world powers.
