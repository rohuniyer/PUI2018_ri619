### Assignment 1 - Plot Review for Cyrus Blankinship


[Cyrus_plot.png]

The two plots show very interesting trends in tourist vs. New Yorker ridership throughout the day. The plots are both easy
easy to read, however I would have liked to see another plot showing only the difference curves to get a clearer idea of 
the discrepancies between weekday and weekend. Aesthetically the plots look very good and clearly depict the overall goal
of the analysis. 

The plots are not deforming the data to show a point however another possible avenue to improve the visualization would be
a time series of the number of rides started for each hour rather than just the CDF.
