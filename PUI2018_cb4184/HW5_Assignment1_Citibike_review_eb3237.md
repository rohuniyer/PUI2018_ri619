** Review of the Citibike project by cb4184 - Cyrus Blankinship** 


**(a) Null and alternative hypotheses**

The idea for the Null hypothesis looks interesting but I am not sure it was formulated correctly. 

The instructions from the Professor were "At this point of the class it is easier to run tests of proportions or similar, 
and work with categorical data. Categorical can be anhything that can be punt into classes (e.g. day/night, male/female, 2014/2015/2016..)

There was no "young adults" group set to compare it with the "control group". 

Moreover, the graph shows "entire population" compared to "young adults".

Also the alpha was not stated.

cb4184 - Null Hypothesis  H0:
Young adults (ages 18-30) on average ride citi bikes equal or smaller distances per trip to the control group.

Suggested by eb3237 - Null Hypothesis  H0:
Young adults (ages 18-30) ride equal or smaller average distances per trip than adults of other age groups.  

Suggested by eb3237 - The Alternative hypothesis Ha:
Young adults (ages 18-30) ride greater average distances per trip than adults of other age groups. 


**(b) Verify that the the data supports the project**

1) The formula for average trip has limitations as the author suggested. He is using Haversine formula. 
He should state additional limitations, for example since we don't know which exact route a citibike user actually took without GPS data on each bike, the average trip distance is not calculated properly. 

2) As I said above, riders were not divided in groups to compare. 
So no distribution of average distance of Citibike bikers by age.

**(c) Appropriate test to test H0 given the type of data, and the question asked**

No test presented. Author did not stay whether he accepts or rejects his Null hypothesis. 

Z-test would be an appropriate test to test H0 given the type of data. 
 
Would be good to set two groups of categorical data and run the analysis, 
hense accept or reject the Null hypothesis as per instruction.
