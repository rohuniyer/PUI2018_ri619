# Week 5 PUI Homework

## Notes
* For assignment 3, I worked with Sam Burns. He forwarded me several articles explaining chi squared tests and i worked independently after that. We then compared our results with one another
* For assignment 4, I worked with Sam Burns & Pablo Barriga to make sense of the different statistical tests and their results. 

## Assignment 1: Reviewing classmates Citibike project proposal
* I was paired with LindaLv11
* After reviewing, I made several suggestions to change the null hypothesis and do a bit more data cleanup.
* I also suggested that she use a Z test for Unpaired data
* I submitted a pull request at 5pm on 10/8/2018

## Assignment 2: Literature choices of statistical tests
* I worked independently on this assignment
