##  1. *verify that their Null and alternative hypotheses are formulated correctly* 
1.1. The null and alternative hypotheses are correct and testable. 

1.2. The formula is a bit confusing. Instead of

_$H_0$_ : $\frac{O_{\mathrm{total-distance}}}{O_{\mathrm{tripnumber}}} <= \frac{Y_{\mathrm{total-distance}}}{Y_{\mathrm{tripnumber}}}$

a better way will be:

_$H_0$_ : $\frac{Total Distance_{\mathrm{old}}}{Trip Counts_{\mathrm{old}}} <= \frac{Total Distance_{\mathrm{young}}}{Trip Counts_{\mathrm{young}}}$ 

## 2. verify that the data supports the project
2.1. The data you extracted can be used to support your research. 

2.2. I will suggest you to make titles of the graphs more meaningful. For example, instead of naming a histogram "Histogram", name the graph "Trip Count Distribution by Age." 

2.3. The graphs does not explore the hypothesis far enough though. I will suggest you to slip your sample group into two groups by age, and compare their average distance.

## 3. chose an appropriate test to test H0 given the type of data, and the question asked

3.1. Since you are comparing two unpaired sample groups, which means that you are looking for the significance of the difference between the groups, I will suggest you to run the t test.
