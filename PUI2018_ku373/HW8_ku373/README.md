Figure1
Description: Figure1 shows population growth rates in Brooklyn and Manhattan (Projection after 2010). The data was retreived from NYC open data, New York City Population by Borough, 1950 - 2040 and coverted to growth rates. 
We can see that after 2020 the rate of Manhattan drops drastically while that of Brooklyn keeps about 3%. 

Color: To make the graph simple, I used black and gray color, which are easily understandable for people suffering from color-blindness.
