## This is a review file for plots created by pyk222.

pyk222 describes the change of traffic volumes on Little Clove Road from 2 to 3 pm between Sep 28 2012 Oct 07 2012.

CLARITY: The figure is simple and easy to understand. 

ESTHETIC: To improve the graph, I would say that the legend is not necessary because there is only one data series. pyk222 should consider eliminating the legend. Color choice is OK. There is nothing distructing me other than the legend. 

HONESTY: pyk222 shows the data source and original coding. Therefore, it is obviously reproduceble.
