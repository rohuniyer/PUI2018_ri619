### This is a file which reviews plots created by xh1163.

xh1163 created a figure which describes the relationship between Day of week and the number of riders age under and over 40 in February 2014. 

CLARITY: This figure clearly shows the absolute numbers for each age group. However, it is a little bit difficult to figure out the distribution of percentages of riders for each day (e.g. Monday:25%), which is quite important imformation as well. In order to compare 2 age groups, you could use distribution of percentages of bikers instead of absolute numbers to make histogram. Depends on the purpose of the graph though.

ESTHETIC: The figure is simple and easy to understand. xh1163 uses blue and orange so that people with most types of color blind can understand the difference. Quantities are easy to understand.

HONESTY: xh1163 shows the original code, so I can say that the graph is reproduceble. In fact, I successed to download the original data from the link mentioned in the original code.
